## The Assignment (also in dropbox)

The requirement is to make a design for the fat cat secret app you described in assignment 2-3. You need to start with [this github repository](https://github.com/rhildred/fatcatsecret). An 85% effort is to include some audience building posts in the way that you did the midterm and to change the static_pane_1.ejs, static_pane_2.ejs and static_pane_3.ejs to include behaviours from your assignment 2-3.

You have a choice for how you get a mark over 85%.

1) You can design secondary screens that slide out when you press on your static panes for 5% per secondary screen.

2) You can go deep on 1 secondary screen and integrate with a firebase "backend" for 5% for the secondary screen and 10% for getting data in to firebase.

I have provided scaffolding for the 85% portion of your project and a video here. I would like to provide more scaffolding for the secondary screens and firebase as my time allows.
